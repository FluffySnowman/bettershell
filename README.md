# BetterShell

This is a program to make your terminal startup look cooler and make your work more efficient.

Simple type in the name of your shell (ex: `zsh` or `bash`) when `bettershell.sh` is run and your new terminal look shall be applied when you start a new session/login.

```bash
sh bettershell.sh
```

This will update your terminal's startup settings with the ones in main.txt

Have fun using your new shell look :)
