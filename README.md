# TermStart

This is a program to make your terminal startup look cooler and make your work more efficient.

To use this program, open your favourite text editor (such as `nano` or `visual studio code`) and edit the file named `termstart.sh`.

Go to the end of the first line and change the path `~/.zshrc` to the rc of your shell. Ex: `bash`'s rc would be located in `~/.bashrc`.

Once you have done this, run `termstart.sh` by doing these commands:

```bash
sh termstart.sh
```

This will update your terminal's startup settings with the ones in main.txt

Have fun using your new shell look :)
